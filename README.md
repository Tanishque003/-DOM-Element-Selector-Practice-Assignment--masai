# -DOM-Element-Selector-Practice-Assignment--masai


## Overview
This project demonstrates DOM manipulation techniques in JavaScript by creating a simple webpage. The webpage allows for the dynamic modification of various HTML elements using different DOM selection methods. Users can see real-time changes to the content and styles of elements based on user-defined manipulations.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the webpage.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for manipulating the DOM elements.

## HTML Structure
The HTML file includes:
- A heading with the `id` `main-heading`.
- Several paragraphs, some with the class `text-content`.
- An image with the `id` `main-image`.
- A `div` with the class `container` that contains additional paragraphs and another image.

## JavaScript DOM Manipulation
The JavaScript code performs the following operations:
1. **Select the heading** using `getElementById` and change its text content.
2. **Select paragraphs** with the class `text-content` using `getElementsByClassName` and change their text color to blue.
3. **Select the image** using `querySelector` and change its source.
4. **Select the container div** using `querySelector` and change its background color.
5. **Select all paragraphs** inside the container using `querySelectorAll` and update their text content.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Observe the changes made to the webpage by the JavaScript code.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have a web browser installed.
2. Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the DOM manipulations in action.

## Customization
Feel free to modify the HTML structure, styles, and JavaScript code to explore different DOM manipulation techniques. You can change text, styles, and add more elements as needed.
